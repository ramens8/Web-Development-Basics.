Heading Sizes - 1 is largest, 6 is smallest)

<hr /> - Horizontal line (self-closing)

Images (self-closing)

../image.bmp (going up a level for relative file paths) 

Linking with Anchor Elements
<a href="destination">I am an internal link</a>
Connects and links to
<p id="destination">I am the destination of the link</p>

Opening a new tab based on target value
<a target="_blank" href="external website">title of external website</a>

Radio Buttons (circle shaped) - Check circles where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options. Best practice to set for a (definition of the label) to allow assistive technologies to create linked relationships between label and input element.
<label for="indoor".
	<input id="indoor" type"radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>

Checkboxes (square) - Questions that may have more than one answer
<label for="identification"><input id="identification" type"checkbox" name="category">Text</label>

Radio Buttons & Checkboxes - Adding "Checked" at the start.
Eg., <label for="indoor"><input id="indoor" type"=radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked>indoor</label>
